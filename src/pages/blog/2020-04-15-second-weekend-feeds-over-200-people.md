On April 12th, volunteers from the organization FeedFolksLA delivered 54 food boxes from local farms to seniors, first responders, and vulnerable families. They raised $1250 from 23 people, which covered the $25 per box cost for the weekend’s haul.

A total of 216 people were fed due to the coordinated efforts of people in the Mission Hills, Silver Lake, and East Hollywood areas.

To date, FeedFolksLA has been able to organize the delivery of 79 food boxes from 3 farms to feed a total of 316 people in 4 neighborhoods. 

We're thrilled to be supporting them by creating the digital tools that make the process of helping people even easier, especially as the volume and complexity of their deliveries increase.
