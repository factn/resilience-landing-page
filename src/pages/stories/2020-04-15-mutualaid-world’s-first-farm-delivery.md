In the first weekend of April 2020, FeedFolks piloted their first farm pickup and delivery service to Studio City in Los Angeles, California. They're one of the first local organizations we've connected with to develop the software that will help them coordinate deliveries. By following their process, we've been able to make sure we're creating tools that are both useful and easy to use.

After collecting monetary donations, contacting a farm, and connecting with people who need help, FeedFolks LA was ready for delivery. One volunteer loaded their car with produce from [McGrath Family Farms](http://www.mcgrathfamilyfarm.com/), an organic, sustainable farm in Southern California who has been farming this land for 5 generations.

Boxes were donated to first responders, and citizens who've been gravely impacted by COVID-19 in North Hollywood.

This weekend, April 11th and 12th, FeedFolksLA will be doubling their deliveries and expanding to three additional Southern California neighborhoodsâ€”Mission Hills, East Hollywood and Silver Lake.
