On April 12th, volunteers from the organization FeedFolksLA delivered 54 food boxes from local farms to seniors, first responders, and vulnerable families. They raised $1250 from 23 people, which covered the $25 per box cost for the weekendâ€™s haul.

To date, FeedFolksLA has been able to organize the delivery of 79 food boxes from 3 farms to feed a total of 316 people in 4 neighborhoods. 

We're thrilled to be supporting them by creating the digital tools that make the process of helping people even easier, especially as the volume and complexity of their deliveries increase.
