Our governments and institutions are struggling to respond to the needs of the moment—more reactive than proactive, more damage control than visionary. But the people are here and already demonstrating our ability to care for each other. Across the country, local communities are organizing to provide aid.

Right now, there are dozens of individual projects using things like spreadsheets, online surveys, Slack, and Zoom to identify and track needs and match them with the people who can help. Inspiring and ingenious solutions are being developed, but most of them are limited by the capacity of technology that was not built for this purpose. And when an innovation is made in one community, it is not easy to share and implement in another one.

MutualAid.world is a project to help local organizers do their work by providing ready-made, open-source, digital tools to meet the needs of these local aid projects. We’re creating free software that can be utilized and shared by groups all over the world.

Let’s show the full power of the collaboration, creativity, generosity, and compassion that we’re capable of. Let’s come together as an interdependent, empowering community capable of responding to the most complex challenges. And let’s create an infrastructure that will not only take care of us through this moment, but prepare us for the challenges in the coming years.

We are the people. When we have each other, we have all we need.

This is the best of the human spirit
