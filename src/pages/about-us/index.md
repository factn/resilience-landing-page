MutualAid.World is a grassroots crisis response project creating open-source digital tools to help organizations coordinate aid on the ground. 

We’re an all-volunteer, global team made up of developers, designers, project managers, lawyers, data scientists, strategists, writers, and translators.

Our goal is to support the planning, organization, and administration of local missions so organizers can focus on their communities—building relationships instead of spreadsheets.

We are here to empower local leaders who are already organizing their response; and we'll continue to build features in direct response to the needs of mutual aid organizers like you.

Our hope is that these tools will not only support our communities during this pandemic, but also through the probable recession and coming turbulences of climate change.

Our Resilience App allows us to join together, leveraging the power of technology and our care for one another to create a network far greater than we can alone.
